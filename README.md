# Web Scraper RM

## Purpose

This web scraper is a practice in using JS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and many other tech items that I have either used in the past but need refreshing or new things I wanted to learn. It also gives me the opportunity to collect the text from online books that I've purchase but the company that provides them online have not been very reliable (Espescially if they can cance the book, retitle it, and charge their customers for the "honor" of using "their" material...aka corporate greedy jerks). No more ranting. Only programming remains.

## Plan

Here is the "going-in" plan. I assume they will change or be better fleshed out as I progress:

- [ ] Get content from URL and show it in the console
- [ ] Target specific parts of the content and show it in the console
- [ ] Build page objects from the specified content and show it in the console
- [ ] Port content to the front end
- [ ] Save content in a text document
- [ ] Add form input on front end to change the web page (URL) I am targeting the scrape
- [ ] Add form controls to title and save content to a text document

## Additional Ideas

These are the things I would like to add:

- [ ] Form input box to add my own markers. For example, It would be cool if I could add a `{*spell-content*}` marker that noted the following text as a relating to a spell-content category. Later, I could run a python script to go line by line through the text files and place this text into a database table. As such, we could use other markers:
      \t- `{*spell-title*}`
      \t- `{*spell-content*}`
      \t- `{*spell-cat*}`
      \t- `{*spell-damage*}`
      \t- `{*spell-buff*}`
      \t- `{*spell-heal*}`
      etcetera
- [ ] Make things look "pretty." Such as, denote titles, sub-titles, bold and emphasis

## Further Notes

I am sure there are a lot of other things I'll come up as I continue. Some of the things will be put in my log. Important things that I plan to add or have accomplished will be place in this "living" readme (rm) doc. I think it would be fun if I could get this web-app popular enough that others would (1) want to use it; (2) participate in making it better; and (3) get their own purchased books from this diplorible corporation before they loose their hard-earned money on the whims of a money hungry CEO.
